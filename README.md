# osCommerce-GOLD-AdminBS
osCommerce GOLD | Now fully responsive!

As the title already says this osCommerce version is now fully responsive.
The install, back end and front end are now fully bootstrapped.

I took the responsive install from the EDGE version and added it to the regular GOLD version.
Regarding the admin area, I didn't go crazy with it, I couldn't anyway skill-wise. lol
I tried to keep it as close to the current non-BS admin as possible to maintain the compatibility with the
current available addons for osC 2.3.x

You can now access your admin with a tablet or anything bigger then a mobile phone.
I couldn't get every page to work on a resolution of 320x480 or 360x640.

Anyway, enjoy and if anything is you can find me in the osC forum.
